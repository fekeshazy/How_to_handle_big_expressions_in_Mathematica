# Handling Large Symbolic Expressions in Mathematica

This repository contains a collection of functions, examples, and notes on how to **optimize Mathematica for large-scale symbolic algebra**.  
The material is based on my experience during my PhD research in precision quantum chromodynamics, where expressions with millions of terms are common and Mathematica’s performance limitations quickly become apparent.

## Motivation

Mathematica is widely used in high-energy physics and related fields thanks to its rich ecosystem of packages (`FeynCalc`, `PolyLogTools`, `HypExp`, `LinApart`, etc.) and intuitive syntax.  
However, some **core symbolic functions** (e.g. `Expand`, `Series`, `Apart` etc) scale poorly with large expressions. This repository provides **workarounds and optimized methods** that make it possible to work with “big” algebraic expressions inside Mathematica.

## Contents

- the Text_of_blog_post_polished.txt file contains the text of the blog post at 
- the directory Examples contain:
         
         - the code in Functions.m
         - and their corresponding examples in Examples.m
         - the other .mx files are the expression used in the examples.

## Target Audience

This post was intended for **Mathematica-fluent users** who regularly manipulate symbolic expressions but may not have written such optimization functions themselves but have to push Mathematica beyond its default performance limits.

## Disclaimer

- The functions here are **prototypes**: they may not handle all edge cases, and further polishing is needed for production use.  
- My goal is to share **working strategies**, not to replace Mathematica’s built-in functions.  
- Advanced users will recognize many of these “tricks” — the purpose is to flatten the learning curve for newcomers.
